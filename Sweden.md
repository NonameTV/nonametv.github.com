Sweden

The NonameTV framework was initially developed to provide listings for Sweden by Mattias Holmlund who still maintains the backend for Sweden today. Users of the data can get help and report problems in our forum.

I try to run the Swedish site as openly as possible. All code is checked into the git-repository and the configuration file for Sweden is maintained in the git-repository under examples/se/nonametv.conf.

Unfortunately, many of the sources that we fetch data from are not available to the public. They require permission to access them. Therefore, I have set up a proxy for some of the sources that allows me to give out access to the data-sources without revealing the password to the actual press-site. This proxy is available via http://converter.xmltv.se/proxy. You need an account to access this proxy. Please contact me to get an account. I haven't been able to proxy all data sources yet. Therefore, the configuration for some of the grabbers is maintained in an override.conf-file that is not publicly available.

You can look at the data from the conversion process for Sweden at http://converter.xmltv.se. It provides access to the machine doing the actual data gathering for Sweden and includes the source data for all channels.
Data Copyright

Note that we can only give you permission to use the code that gathers the data. This does not mean that you have permission to redistribute that data. If you want to run your own NonameTV server and distribute the resulting data, you have to acquire permission from the rights holders yourself.
